                <p class="u-margin-bottom-30">OGP formed in 2003 when a couple of avid puck collectors got together and created the website www.officialgamepuck.com. Within a couple of months, they began printing their first pucks screen printing them in a garage by hand. They soon recognized that there was an opportunity to provide better quality and service than what was available in the marketplace at that time and soon committed to buy their first automated printing equipment. Things happened quickly.</p>
                
                 <p class="u-margin-bottom-30">It wasn't long before leagues such as the USHL and OHL recognized OGP's high level of service and awarded OGP with their business. Other leagues such as the QMJHL, WHL, NAHL, OJHL and GOJHL soon followed. It wasn't long before they outgrew the garage and moved into their present location in Bolton, ON which was recently doubled in size.</p>
                 
                 <p class="u-margin-bottom-30">After making their mark with custom printed pucks, OGP expanded their operation adding new printing equipment and methods to dramatically expand their product offering to their growing and loyal customer base stretching all across North America and beyond. While OGP has grown over the years, it has remained true to the core principles that set OGP on its path of success. OGP continues to offer high quality products at a great price and turns orders around fast. It's really that simple. If it's physically possible to do it, we get it done.</p>
                 
                 <p class="u-margin-bottom-30">If you're ever in the area, feel free to stop by and we'll proudly show you our operation.</p>

                <h4 class="heading-2">Quality</h4>
                <p class="u-margin-bottom-30">Our first priority is quality. With our pucks we have invested countless hours learning how to achieve great looking logos with the best possible adhesion. Printing on rubber is not easy. That dedication to quality has carried over to all of our other products. We won't introduce a new product until we are satisfied with the quality.</p>
            
                
                <h4 class="heading-2">Price</h4>
                <p class="u-margin-bottom-30">We have strived to keep our costs to a minimum so that we can provide our products at the best possible price. Don't like our price? Tell us. Dealers and other Resellers are welcome to contact us.</p>
                
                <h4 class="heading-2">Service</h4>

                <h4 class="heading-2">Lead Time</h4>
                <p class="u-margin-bottom-30">We can accommodate virtually any rush situation. So don't feel bad coming to us at the last minute with your project. If it's physically possible, we'll get it done for you.</p>    
                
                                                            
                <h4 class="heading-2">Reputation</h4>
                <p class="u-margin-bottom-30">We are the exclusive puck supplier to the OHL, WHL, QMJHL and USHL and a preferred supplier to many other leagues such as the NAHL, OJHL and GOJHL. We're also a licensed supplier to the AHL and we sell directly to many NHL clubs and numerous corporate clients. You don't get this list of customers without following through on what you promise. But we not only get these sort of customers, we keep them. Most have been with us for over 10 years now.</p>     
                
                <h4 class="heading-2">Experience</h4>
                <p class="u-margin-bottom-30">We have printed millions of pucks and other products. We are also owner operated and very hands on. We have control over our process.</p>   
                
                <h4 class="heading-2">Honesty</h4>
                <p class="u-margin-bottom-30">Simply put, we'll tell you the truth. So many of our competitors will tell you want you want to hear to get an order but fail to deliver. We prefer to under promise and over deliver. But if we commit to getting something done you can trust that it will happen. And we won't mislead you or just tell you how great we are. We'd rather just show you.</p>
