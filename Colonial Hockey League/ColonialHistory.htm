    HOCKEY LEAGUE</font></b></font></p>
  <p><b><font color="#FF8080" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1991 - 1997)<font size="+3"><!-- #BeginEditable "title" --><i>

  <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF8080">While 
    the professional game was rapidly growing in the United States, the Senior 
    game was all but dead in Canada unable to attract players interested in playing 
    amateur hockey. In 1991, Colonial Hockey League was formed as a Semi-Professional 
    League centered in Ontario and Michigan. They were able to tap into a couple 
    of Ontario Senior towns (Brantford and Thunder Bay) and a few US centers abandoned 
    by the International Hockey League. Certainly humble beginnings....</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF8080">In 
    its second season, all five charter franchises returned. In addition were 
    expansion teams in Chatham and Muskegon. Once again, the league moved into 
    a former IHL town and into a former Ontario Senior hotbed.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF8080">For 
    it's third season, the Flint Bulldogs reloated to Utica. However, the Flint 
    market was not left vacant as the expansion Flint Generals started up. The 
    league was now up to eight franchises.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF8080">In 
    1994, the St. Thomas Wildcats relocated to London, Ontario. The new London 
    team had struck a tentative affiliation with the St. Louis Blues. At the last 
    minute, the partnership fell apart and the London team retained the Wildcat 
    name. Also, the Chatham Wheels moved into Saginaw, Michigan, another vacant 
    IHL town. Utica renamed their team the Blizzard and Thunder Bay struck a deal 
    with the Ottawa Senators and changed their name to that of their parent club.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF8080">In 
    1995, the league temporarily lost their first franchise. The London Wildcats 
    suspended operations for a year. They returned the following season as the 
    Dayton Ice Bandits (Yet another former IHL town). The league did not actually 
    drop in size since they also added two more expansion teams in the Madison 
    Monsters and Quad City Mallards. The expansion beyond the leagues initial 
    geographical area was a significant step as the league was now an established 
    low level professional league.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF8080">In 
    1996, Thunder Bay dropped their Senators name in favor of the Thunder Cats 
    while the Saginaw Wheels changed their name to the Lumber Kings. The Detroit 
    Falcons became the Port Huron Border Cats (Another former IHL town) and Dayton 
    returned to the league increasing the number of teams to ten.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF8080">This 
    marked the last year for the Colonial Hockey League as they opted to change 
    their name to the United Hockey League in 1997.</font> </p>
