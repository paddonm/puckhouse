<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We welcome contributions of images 
  of pucks to be added to this site. However, we also want to ensure that the 
  best quality of image is used to keep the site attractive and accurate. If you 
  are going to send us an image, please try to follow the following standards:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">File Type</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JPEG is the preferred file type.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Image Layout</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A flat image generated by a puck 
  placed on a scanner is the preferred image layout. Pictures taken with digital 
  cameras generally produce an image that is oval or has a reflection from a flash 
  or other lighting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Image Size</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While we will gladly accept all images 
  sent, to get the best end results, please consider the following. While we often 
  set our scanners to produce images that result in smaller file sizes to save 
  space on our hard drives and time when images are emailed or loaded up, detail 
  is lost in the process. We would prefer that a full size image be sent. This 
  allows us to edit the image on our end without losing much of the quality and 
  keep the images displayed on the site consistent in appearance. This will likely 
  result in a file size of 100 - 130 kb which does take a few minutes to send 
  by email but it's worth the wait. </font></p>
