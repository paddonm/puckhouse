    HOCKEY LEAGUE</font></b></font></p>

  <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF6633">The 
    roots of the CHL go back to the old Eastern Professional Hockey League created 
    by the NHL in 1959. The league essentially converted Senior Hockey teams in 
    Ontario and Quebec into professional teams. What the NHL was looking for was 
    a place to put many of their top players without interference. At that time, 
    AHL and WHL teams were much more independent than they are now and the NHL 
    wanted more control over the development of their players.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF6633">The 
    league struggled financially and by 1962, was down to just four teams, one 
    of which had already moved States-side to Syracuse. The Syracuse team was 
    drawing less fans than a local Junior team and they moved midseason to become 
    the St. Louis Braves.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF6633">In 
    1963, the three remaining teams left in Canada were relocated to larger US 
    centers and the Central Professional Hockey League was born. The NY Rangers 
    added the St. Paul Rangers to league and in its first season the league had 
    five teams. Unfortunately, the first season did see tragedy in Indianapolis. 
    Three weeks into the season, their arena burnt down and Detroit relocated 
    the franchise to Cincinnati.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF6633">In 
    1964, Toronto set up the Tulsa Ice Oilers and the league was now a six team 
    league mirroring the NHL. Detroit's move to Cincinnati proved short-lived 
    as they packed up the team again and sent them to Memphis.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF6633">Team 
    moves were common in the CHL. In 1965, Boston moved their team out of Minneapolis 
    and into Oklahoma City and Montreal moved their team out of Omaha and into 
    Houston. The following year, New York took their team out of St. Paul and 
    into the recently vacated Omaha market.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF6633">In 
    1967, expansion in the NHL had a major impact. The St. Louis market was lost 
    to the NHL and the team moved to Dallas. Meanwhile Detroit moved out of Memphis 
    and into Fort Worth. The newly formed Minnesota North Stars of the NHL set 
    up a farm team in Memphis called the 'South Stars'. Likewise, the St. Louis 
    Blues of the NHL set up the Kansas City Blues. At the end of the season, the 
    league shortened its name and became the Central Hockey League. However, the 
    original name could still be found on the backs of pucks as late as 1975.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF6633">The 
    league grew again in 1968, when the Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL set up 
    the Amarillo Wranglers. This would prove to be the highpoint of the league.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF6633">In 
    1969, the Montreal Canadiens decided to pull their Houston Apollos out of 
    the league and set up close to home in the AHL. Also, the Amarillo Wranglers 
    struggled and the franchise was suspended for one year only to fold shortly 
    after. The Memphis South Stars were also relocated to Des Moines, Iowa where 
    they played only one season before suspending operations.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF6633">In 
    1972, the league nearly came to an end. The formation of the WHA drained much 
    of the talent of the league. Boston had also set up a new team close to home 
    in the AHL pulling the plug on the Oklahoma City Blazers. The St. Louis Blues 
    also shut down their Kansas City Blues. The league was suddenly down to just 
    four teams and played an interlocking schedule with another devistated league, 
    the WHL.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF6633">The 
    league rebounded slightly in 1973 when they added the Albuquerque Six Guns 
    and a new team was set up in Oklahoma City.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF6633">The 
    following year, the WHL folded. Three of its teams joined the CHL giving the 
    league a short-lived boost. Both the Seattle Totems and Denver Spurs lasted 
    just one season. The Salt Lake City Golden Eagles, however, proved to be a 
    good addition outlasting the CHL. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF6633">Fan 
    support in the league dropped further in the 1970's as teams and affiliations 
    became more fluid. There was little continuity from season to season on which 
    fan support could be built. The league continued to struggle.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF6633">In 
    1977, the league added the Phoenix Roadrunners. This former WHA team did something 
    very unusual in their only season in the league. The team left midseason to 
    join another league. A new West Coast league (PHL) was formed at Christmas 
    and Phoenix left the CHL and joined the new league.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF6633">In 
    1979, the CHL got another boost when the WHA folded. The league added four 
    former WHA markets (Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Birmingham and Houston) and 
    was once again back up to nine teams. For the next three seasons, the league 
    managed to start the year with nine teams but suffered through numerous relocated, 
    expansions and contractions. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF6633">By 
    1982, the writing was on the wall for the CHL. They lost three of their oldest 
    markets when the Dallas Black Hawks, Oklahoma City Stars and Forth Worth Texans 
    did not start start the year. They started with just six teams, two of which 
    were new.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF6633">In 
    1983, the league started with just five teams. Both Wichita and Birmingham 
    packed it in while the league tried to make a go of it in Montana. During 
    the season, the Tulsa Oilers who had been in the league since 1964, could 
    no longer make a go of it in Tulsa and finished the season in Denver. The 
    league also played against both the Canadian and US Olympic teams and counted 
    the games in the standings but this gimick couldn't save the league. The league 
    folded in 1984 with Indianapolis and Salt Lake City moving on to join the 
    IHL.</font></p>
