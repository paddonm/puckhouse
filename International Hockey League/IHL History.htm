    Hockey League</font></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The International 
    Hockey League was formed in Windsor, Ontario on Dec. 5, 1945. It was largely 
    a resurrection of the old Michigan-Ontario League that existed prior to WWII. 
    The league initially consisted of two Detroit based teams and two Windsor 
    based teams, one of which was a junior team. The league name came from this 
    cross border arrangement.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The league soon became 
    a strictly Senior league and expanded into other US markets. On occasion, 
    the league reached into centers that had been long associated with Central 
    leagues, however its footing remained the Michigan-Ohio area. The International 
    aspect of the 'I' ended in 1963 when Windsor and Chatham packed it in. It 
    would be over 30 years before another Canadian center would join the league 
    putting the 'I' back in the IHL.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Senior league 
    evolved into a low level professional league in the 1960's and 1970's. The 
    1980's presented an opportunity for the league to fill the void westward after 
    the demise of the WHL, CHL and WHA. Initially, the IHL was successful at exploiting 
    this situation and in the 1990's was rivaling the AHL as the top minor league. 
    There was even an illusion of grandeur among some of the IHL's larger market 
    team owners that the 'I' could one day rival the NHL.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The illusion quickly 
    turned to a nightmare. The IHL was overextended and many of the established 
    smaller markets were losing money while the novelty in the newer larger markets 
    was wearing off. Some teams began to fold while others jumped ship to supposedly 
    lesser leagues.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The IHL would pay 
    dearly for abandoning the small but established markets that had formed the 
    foundation of the league. The United Hockey League was quietly filling the 
    void left by the IHL during its time of rapid growth. Not only had the IHL 
    failed to become a rival to the NHL, it could no longer return to its traditional 
    base. It had foolishly allowed the UHL to claim its smaller markets.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Faced with an inevitable 
    collapse, the IHL officially disbanded in 2001 with six of its stronger markets 
    being absorbed by the AHL as expansion teams. The Orlando Solar Bears were 
    the last team to win the Turner Cup.</font></p>
