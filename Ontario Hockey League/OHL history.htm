  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Junior hockey in Ontario 
    has a long and storied history. Out of its modest beginnings at the turn of 
    the century, junior hockey quickly grew into an organized and entertaining 
    brand of hockey. The end of WWI marked the beginning of the Memorial Cup, 
    the symbol of junior hockey supremacy in Canada. Teams from all across the 
    province participated in provincial play downs in the hope of representing 
    Eastern Canada in the Memorial Cup finals. As each year passed, the number 
    of communities participating in junior hockey grew and the calibre of play 
    widened. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><u><font color="#FF3333">OHA 
    Junior 'A' (1934-1972)</font></u></i></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1934, junior hockey 
    was effectively split into 'A' and 'B' divisions with the 'A' level teams 
    competing for the Memorial Cup while the 'B' level teams competed for the 
    Sutherland Cup, which is still Ontario's Jr. B championship trophy. The 1930's 
    gave birth to noted teams such as the Oshawa Generals, St. Michaels Majors 
    and the Toronto Marlboros. Other notable teams of that era where the Young 
    Rangers, Toronto Native Sons, and the Stratford Midgets.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 1940's welcomed 
    new communities to the limelight such as the Barrie Flyers, Guelph Biltmores, 
    Stratford Kroehlers and the St. Catharines TeePees. The first version of the 
    Windsor Spitfires also appeared in the 1940's only to fade away in the early 
    50's. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 1950's saw other 
    cities join in. The Kitchener Greenshirts entered the league only to move 
    on to become the Peterborough Petes. Hamilton also joined as the Tiger-Cubs 
    (later Red Wings). The 1950's also saw inter-league play with Quebec based 
    teams.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 1960's saw change. 
    Travel became an issue for teams as the league grew (in particular, Toronto 
    St. Mikes). To deal with the travel, the league effectively split into a metro 
    Toronto league and a league for the rest of the province. While the Metro 
    Jr. A League did have notable teams such as St. Mikes, Marlboros and Generals; 
    it also had some less notable teams such as the Brampton 7ups, Unionville 
    Seaforths and Knob Hill Farms. The division lasted just 2 seasons and a new 
    unified Junior A league emerged. Unfortunately, this meant the end of St. 
    Michaels. However, new chapters were opened. Joining the league were the Montreal 
    Jr. Canadiens, Kitchener Rangers, St. Catharines Black Hawks, Niagara Falls 
    Flyers, London Nationals (later Knights) and the Ottawa 67's.</font></p>
  <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><u><font color="#FF3333">OHA 
    Major Junior 'A' (1972 - 1981) </font></u></i></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 1970's ushered 
    in more change. Junior A hockey split again into Tier I and Tier II. The only 
    Tier I league in the province became known as the OHA Major Jr. A. Its winner 
    represented the Ontario in a round robin Memorial Cup with a team from the 
    West and another team from Quebec. Communities such as Sudbury (transfer from 
    Niagara Falls) and SSM that had been part of the NOHA prior to the Tier I/Tier 
    II split, joined the Major Jr. A ranks to remain part of the Memorial Cup 
    hunt. The 70's also saw the Kingston Canadians join the league and the rebirth 
    of the Windsor Spitfires.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u><i><font color="#FF3333">Ontario 
    Hockey League (1981 - Present)</font></i></u></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1981, the league 
    was renamed the OHL. The league added the Guelph Platers and Belleville Bulls 
    and welcomed the Cornwall Royals from the QMJHL. North Bay took in the second 
    version of the NF Flyers. Franchises also recycled through Brantford and Hamilton. 
    The end of the decade saw the end of another storied team, the Toronto Marlboros 
    as they relocated to become the Hamilton Dukes. It also saw the end of the 
    Kingston Canadians as they were renamed the Raiders only to become the Frontenacs 
    the following year.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 1990's saw the 
    league expand into the US. The first franchise the expansion Detroit Ambassadors 
    (later Jr. Red Wings and Plymouth Whalers) and the second the Erie Otters. 
    The Otters could trace their heritage back to the Hamilton Tiger Cubs of 1953. 
    Newmarket also briefly had the Royals before moving on to become the Sarnia 
    Sting. The Dukes became the Guelph Storm; filling the void left when the Platers 
    relocated to Owen Sound. Barrie rejoined the league in 1995 with the Colts 
    and the Toronto St. Micheals Majors also rejoined the league in 1997 after 
    a 34-year absence. The league continued to expand with 2 new teams in 1998; 
    Don Cherry's Mississauga Ice Dogs and the Brampton Battalion.</font></p>
