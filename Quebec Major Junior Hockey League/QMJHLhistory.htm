    MAJOR JUNIOR HOCKEY LEAGUE</font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2" color="#3399FF"> 
    </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#3399FF" size="+1">1969 
    - Present</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Organized hockey has 
    deep roots in Quebec. The earliest leagues started in the Ottawa-Montreal-Quebec 
    City corridor. While senior and professional hockey developed rapidly in this 
    area, the development of junior hockey quickly lagged behind Ontario and Western 
    Canada</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While there were various 
    leagues and teams throughout the early half of the 20th century, it wasn't 
    until 1949 that Quebec produced its first Memorial Cup winner, the Montreal 
    Royals. It followed up with the Montreal Jr. Canadiens winning the Cup in 
    1950. However, this marked a high point in Quebec junior hockey.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By 1953, the top junior 
    league in Quebec was a small 4-team league and had turned to the OHA to provide 
    competition through an interlocking schedule. The league also became embroiled 
    in a dispute with the CAHA that resulted in the league briefly becoming ineligible 
    for Memorial Cup competition. As a result of this dispute, the Quebec Citadelles 
    started the 1953-54 season in the OHA. The dispute was resolved and Quebec 
    returned to a provincial league in rapid decline.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Montreal Canadiens 
    ended up establishing an independent junior team that played exhibition games 
    and participated in Senior competition. Eventually, this team found a home 
    in the OHA in 1961. The major Quebec papers largely ignored local leagues 
    and focused most of their coverage on the Jr. Canadiens and the OHA. The Montreal 
    Jr. Canadiens gave Quebec back to back Cup in 1969 and 1970 but they did so 
    as part of the OHA.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, back in 
    Quebec two leagues began to emerge. The Montreal Metro Jr. 'A' league formed 
    in 1955 while a provincial league also grew and improved through NHL sponsorship. 
    In 1969, these two leagues merged to form the QMJHL. The second year of the 
    new league produced the Guy Lafleur led Quebec Remparts who captured the Memorial 
    Cup in 1971. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1972, the Cornwall 
    Royals, the lone Ontario-based team, went on to win the Cup. It followed up 
    this accomplishment with back to back wins in the early 1980's. However, a 
    dispute developed over Cornwall's participation in the Ontario draft while 
    playing as part of a Quebec based league. The dispute was resolved when Cornwall 
    somewhat reluctantly left the QMJHL to join the OHL.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The league has certainly 
    had its share of franchise moves and name changes. After losing a few of the 
    original franchises, the league was relatively stable throughout the 1970's 
    as a 10-team loop.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1984, the league 
    added its only ever American based team, the Plattsburgh Pioneers. The Pioneers 
    tried to compete with mostly local talent. Competitive they were not. They 
    played about 3 month without winning a game and folded. The league wiped out 
    any record of their existence. Not only were future games wiped out but so 
    were the past wins against them. The original Quebec Remparts also folded 
    at the end of the season.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The league expanded 
    again into Longueuil in 1988 and grew to 12 teams once again in 1990 when 
    the Beauport Harfangs joined the league. Val d'Or followed in 1993 to make 
    it a 13-team loop.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the 1990's, the 
    league expanded beyond the Quebec borders once again. This time into Atlantic 
    Canada when it added the Halifax Mooseheads and Moncton Alpines (later Wildcats). 
    The league continues to steadily expand with the addition of the Baie-Comeau 
    Drakkar and a new entry from Montreal. The Montreal Rockets are named after 
    arguably the greatest French Canadian hockey player in history, Maurice 'Rocket' 
    Richard.</font> </p>
