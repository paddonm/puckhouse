    HOCKEY LEAGUE</font></b></font></p>
  <p><b><font color="#66CCFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1936 - Present)<font size="+3"><!-- #BeginEditable "title" --><i>

  <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCFF">Despite 
    its name, the AHL has very deep roots in Canada. It can trace its origins 
    back to two leagues that both started in 1926; the Canadian Professional League 
    (Later International League) and the Canadian-American League. These two leagues 
    merged for the 1936-37 season to form AHL. Four teams were taken from each 
    league to form an eight team league; the same size as the NHL of that time.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCFF">For 
    the most part, franchises were strong and stable. Initial franchises such 
    as the Pittsburgh Hornets, Cleveland Barons and Buffalo Bisons all kept their 
    franchises until either the NHL or WHA expanded into their markets decades 
    later (Buffalo did miss a few years after the roof on their arena, located 
    in Fort Erie, Ontario, caved in after a snow storm. Pittsburgh lost their 
    arena for a few years as well.) The league was strong enough in the early 
    going to spark talk of the league eventually overshadowing the NHL from the 
    likes of a young Harold Ballard.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCFF">The 
    oldest current franchise in the league is the Hershey Bears who joined the 
    league in 1938.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCFF">Eventually, 
    the league settled on being home to the top farm clubs for the NHL. The league 
    stayed rooted in the northeast. The farthest west the ever reached was St. 
    Louis durign the 40's and 50's. Other notable franchises of that era were 
    the Providence Reds, Indianapolis Capitals and Springfield Indians. The second 
    oldest current franchise, the Rochester Americans, joined the league for the 
    1956-57 season, primarily as a replacement team for the Pittsburgh Hornets 
    who suspended operations pending construction of a new arena.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCFF">The 
    AHL returned to its roots when it added the Quebec Aces for the 1959-60 season 
    (Quebec had a franchise in the Can-Am League). The AHL has had at least one 
    Canadian team in the league ever since. The league remained very stable up 
    until NHL expansion. Several communities moved up to the NHL ranks. Also, 
    the growth in the NHL created a need for more farm teams. By 1972, the AHL 
    had grown to a 12-team league. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCFF">Many 
    of the new franchises were not successful. Teams such as the Boston Braves, 
    Cincinnati Swords, Syracuse Eagles, Richmond Robins, Jacksonville Barons and 
    Virginia Wings all had short existences. With travel costs becoming less of 
    a factor, the NHL began turning to rival leagues such as the CHL, IHL, WHL 
    and NAHL (formerly EHL) to set up farm teams. The bottom was hit in 1976-77 
    when the AHL had just 6 teams.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCFF">The 
    AHL's fortunes improved when local rivals the NAHL and SHL folded after the 
    1976-77 season. The AHL quickly grew to 9 teams, taking 2 teams from teh NAHL 
    and 1 from the SHL. The league grew to 10 when it added the Adirondack Red 
    Wings for the 1979-80 season. It continued to expand into Canada with franchises 
    in Moncton and Halifax. Fredriction joined the league in 1981 and Sherbrooke 
    and St. Catharines followed the next season.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCFF">The 
    league remained stable at 13 teams for several years before adding the Utica 
    Devils in 1987. It did not add its 15th team, the Capitol District Islanders, 
    until the 1990-91 season. Providence rejoined the league as the 16th team 
    in 1992. The league grew to 18 teams when it expanded back into Baltimore 
    with the Bandits and took in the Carolina Monarchs from the ECHL in 1995. 
    Two Canadian teams, the Cornwall Aces and PEI Senators, disappeared at the 
    end of the 1995-96 season and were replaced by the Philadelphia Phantoms and 
    Kentucky Thoroughblades.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#66CCFF">The 
    league continues to have strong Canadian representation with teh Hamilton 
    Bulldogs, St. Johns Maple Leafs and St. John Flames. The league continues 
    on its path of stable growth adding several new teams in recent years. It 
    also won out in its battle with the IHL for minor hockey supremacy taking 
    in its strongest franchises in 2001.</font></p>
